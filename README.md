# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. Animations, nav links and hover feature were used for greater interactivity.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

1. In the future I would add more dynamic animations to all the elements.
2. add a link to newspaper reviews of similar restaurant.
